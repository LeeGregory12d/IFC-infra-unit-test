### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a horizontal alignment with a start chainage of 1000 and consisting of a partial clothoid of decreasing radii between two left arcs.
There is no vertical alignment.

That is, it has 
Civil Horizontal Geometry (HG):

- start chainage of 1000
- left arc
- partial clothoid transition of IFC positive decreasing radius of curvature
- left arc

Civil Vertical Geometry (VG): none

In the IFC file there is only the IFC semantic definition of the alignment and no IFC geometry.
The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenarios:

- UT-Alignment-12d-6

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- it has a partial clothoid transition

### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:

| `UT-Alignment-12d-9.png`           | plan view of the alignment, and the segment parameters (with Civil radius)|
