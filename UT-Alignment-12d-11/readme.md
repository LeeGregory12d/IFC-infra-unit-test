### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has an alignment where the vertical alignment starts after the start of the horizontal alignment
and ends before the end of the horizontal alignment.

That is, it has 
Civil Horizontal Geometry (HG):

- left arc
- partial clothoid transition of IFC positive decreasing radius of curvature
- left arc

Civil Vertical Geometry (VG):

- straight that starts after the start of the horizontal
- crest parabola 
- straight
- sag parabola
- straight that ends before the end of the horizontal

In the IFC file there is only the IFC semantic definition of the alignment and no IFC geometry.
The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenarios

- UT-Alignment-12d-9

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- the vertical starts after the horizontal and stops before the end of the horizontal. 

## Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:
