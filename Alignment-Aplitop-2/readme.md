### Intent

This scenario shows an alignment with zero length circular curve between clothoids, zero length line segment between cuves, and a transition curve between two circular curves. Those zero length elements are not present in ifc file, they are just a concept.
Also, alignment includes a 2D representation.

- In 1523.105 station, there is a zero length circular curve with 1103..685 radius.
- In 2622.475 station, there is a zero length segment.
- In 3945.196 station, there is a Clothoid with 972.837 starting radius and 1387.185 end radius.

### Prerequisites
