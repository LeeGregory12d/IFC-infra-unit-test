### Intent

This scenario creates IfcSolidStratum for two small tins to be used as the top and bottom surfaces in the 12d Earthworks UT's.
The two surfaces do not totally overlap each other.

The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

The figure shows:

- plan view of top tin (magenta) and bottom tin (brown) and string lines used for sectioning
- perspective view of top and bottom tins
- section view (0.2 exaggeration) of section through the two tins along the two-point string line "section 1" (white colour)
- section view (0.2 exaggeration) of section through the two tins along the two-point string line section 2" (white colour) 
- long section view (0.2 exaggeration) of section through the two tins along the three-point string line "section 3" (cylan colour)
