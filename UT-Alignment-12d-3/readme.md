### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment with left arc in horizontal and a crest parabola for vertical
That is, it has 
Civil Horizontal Geometry (HG):

- straight
- an arc with IFC positive radius of curvature
- a straight

Civil Vertical Geometry (VG):

- straight
- a crest parabola
- a straight

In the IFC file there is only the IFC semantic definition of the alignment and no IFC geometry.
The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenarios

- UT-Alignment-12d-1
- UT-Alignment-12d-2

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment` with `PredefinedType=PARABOLICARC` for a crest

### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:

| Filename                    | Description                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UT-Alignment-12d-3.ifc`    | the exported content as an IFC file                                                                    |
| `UT-Alignment-12d-3.png`    | plan and long section view of the alignment, and the segment parameters (with Civil radius and percent Grade) |
