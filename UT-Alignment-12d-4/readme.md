 
### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has an alignment with left arc and leading and trailing clothoid transitions in horizontal
 and no vertical geometry
That is, it has 
Civil Horizontal Geometry (HG):

- straight
- left clothoid transition with IFC positive radius of curvature going from 0 to 150
- left arc with IFC positive radius of curvature
- left clothoid transition with IFC positive radius of curvature going from 150 to 0,
- straight

Civil Vertical Geometry (VG): none

In the IFC file there is only the IFC semantic definition of the alignment and no IFC geometry.
The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenarios

- UT-Alignment-12d-1

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- `IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment` with `PredefinedType=CLOTHOID` with positive radius of curvature

### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:

| Filename                           | Description                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UT-Alignment-12d-4.ifc`           | the exported content as an IFC file                                          |
| `UT-Alignment-12d-4.png`           | plan and long section view of the alignment, and table of segment parameters |
