### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has cut and fill elements for bulk earthworks for a small part of a job (blue lines show the extent).

The cut and fill objects are output.
However the voided object (Ground) is large and not required so only the semantics is included and no geometry.
 
The data is in map coordinates MGA2020 and AHD.

The overall ground tin and the rectangle of the area of bulk earthworks is given in the following image:

The IFC was generated by 12d Model. 

### This builds on scenarios
