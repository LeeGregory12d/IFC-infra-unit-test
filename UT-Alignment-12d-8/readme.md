### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has an alignment with start chainage of 1000, left arc in horizontal and crest and sag parabolas for vertical

That is, it has 
Civil Horizontal Geometry (HG):

- start chainage of 1000
- straight
- arc with IFC positive radius of curvature
- straight

Civil Vertical Geometry (VG):

- straight
- crest parabola
- straight
- sag parabola
- straight

My understanding is that nothing will change in the `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment` from UT-Alignment-12d-7 
because `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment.StartDistAlong` is only measured from the start of the horizontal and ignores `IfcAlignmentHorizontal.StartDistAlong` 

In the IFC file there is only the IFC semantic definition of the alignment and no IFC geometry.
The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenarios:

- UT-Alignment-12d-7 with the addition of a start chainage of 1000

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

 `IfcAlignmentHorizontal` with `IfcAlignmentHorizontal.StartDistAlong=1000`

### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:

| Filename                   | Description                                                                                            |

| `UT-Alignment-12d-8.ifc`   | the exported content as an IFC file                                                                    |
| `UT-Alignment-12d-8.png`   | plan and long section view of the alignment, and the segment parameters (with Civil radius and percent Grade) |
